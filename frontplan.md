Use angular-google-maps library

User inputs a location, and in the resolve, the rails api
returns to us the information we want.

We switch to a new state in which a map is drawn.

Using this information provided from the backend, we can draw markers on the map
in order to display different kinds of food trucks/carts.

Then, we can allow the user to click on a marker and have more information
displayed to the user.
